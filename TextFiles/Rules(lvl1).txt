The rules are simple:
Answer the questions ahead.
But choose carefully,
every answer holds a piece of the truth.
From each answer, extract the first letter of the first word. 
If the answer contains more than one word, take the first letter of the first word, 
the second letter of the second word, the third of the third,until you have gathered them all.
With these letters, you must forge a name. A name that whispers the truth you seek. 
A name that unravels the mystery of your parents' deaths.
Time is not your ally. Five minutes. No more. No less.
Fail to complete the task, and the truth will be lost to the shadows forever. 
Be wise. Choose wisely. Your fate depends on it
